# MEgbm
This package provides some machine learning methods for longitudinal and clustered data based on the classic generalized linear mixed effect model, classification and regression trees, model based recursive partitioning trees, and generalized boosted machines. A boosted version of the linear mixed effect model of the [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package is also implemented. 

## Why Use lme4
  - a data mining approach
  - non-linear assumption of fixed-effects
  - can improve prediction accuracy
  - interpretation 
 
## How to get Started? 
Install via devtools: 

```sh
> devtools::install_github("nguforche/MEgbm")
```
## Status
Package is still very experimental
